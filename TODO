List of things we should do when (if) we have time:

*) Replace bundled libical with external one. Versin 4.16.0 should have
   default external libical and optional internal, and version 4.18.0 have
   only external libical
*) Port Globaltime to GTK3
*) Port panel-plugin to GTK3
*) Fix FreeBSD related issues: make does not work and calendar start always with
   Sunday
*) Fix mess with CSS

3) Timezone handling
    This is actually needed only if we want to syncronize several 
    xfcalendar files and search for example common free time for 
    meetings.
    But some of the code is in fact using old ical calls due to missing
    timezone data, which is native to the new version of ical.
*** DONE 4.4 ***

4) Exchange data between different xfcalendar users
    To build group meetings.

5) History files
    Keep expired events in history file and remove them from the main
    xfcalendar file. This would also make the active file smaller and
    faster.
    We need some kind of cleaning function anyway ? so this would be handy
    feature to do both.
*** DONE 4.4 ***
*** RECODED 4.5 ***

6) WEB interface to show xfcalendar appointments on the internet

7) Add pull-down menus in event-list window and appointment window
    These are not dialog windows, they should have a menu each.
*** DONE 4.4 ***

10) more alarm possibilities (like libnotify BUG 2831 and email)
*** Partly DONE 4.5 ***

11) Day, Week, Month view
*** Partly DONE 4.5 ***
