 * orage_month_view_reset_month_cells:

 * Resets all month cells within the month view to match the current month.
 *
 * This function iterates over all cells in the month grid (6 rows Ã— 7 columns),
 * clears each cell, assigns a new date based on the current month and the
 * first visible weekday, and marks whether the cell belongs to a different
 * month.
 *
 * It does not create or destroy cell widgets; existing cells are reused.
 * The function only resets their state and date information.
 *
 * This function does not emit the "reload-requested" signal. It is typically
 * used together with orage_month_view_set_event(), which populates the month
 * view with event data after all cells have been reset and initialized.
 *
 * The resulting grid represents the complete month view layout that
 * corresponds to the date returned by
 * orage_month_view_get_first_day_of_month().
